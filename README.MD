# Benito Fashions Upcycling & Recycling App

## Project Overview
**Benito Fashions** is a sustainable fashion brand dedicated to promoting environmental conservation through the upcycling and recycling of textiles, shoes, clothing, and accessories. The goal is to create a platform that not only facilitates donations and collections of pre-owned items but also offers a marketplace for eco-friendly products made from waste materials like plastics, glass, and textile scraps.

This application serves as a bridge between eco-conscious consumers, environmentally active communities, and Benito Fashions' production unit—encouraging conscious consumption and promoting a circular economy. The Benito Fashions Recycling & Upcycling App aims to revolutionize sustainable fashion by providing an innovative platform for recycling and upcycling textile waste.
